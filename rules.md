# Hunger games like thing (rules)

People have stats. When the user is made, they can choose stats up to 50 points (5 is min).

* Speed (chance to avoid attack and chance to double attack)
* Attack Damage (strength)
* Protection (how much damage gets absorbed)
Stats that aren’t customizable (100 – max 150)
* Motivation (50 – min 1 – max 99)

Turn based game. Attacking is turn based, start of each day is simultaneous choice (all chose and then action gets done).

At the day start, play can:

* Run away
  * Less chance of attack
  * Loose motivation
* Run to other people
  * High chance of attack
  * Higher motivation

Every attack they have the following options:

* Attack
* Try to retreat
* Defensive

This goes on until either they both leave, leave (with a chance of working – speed), or one dies. If they give more damage to the next player than they received the previous turn, they get motivation (and the other way around for less).
The motivation levels dictate how successful you are at things (eg, better attacks with higher motivation).

If they run away in the original day choose and don’t get attacked, they get motivation. But if in an attack, they will lose a significant amount.

To get an attack it is probability, but they can only attack one person per day.
At the end of the day, health is increased by 10hp

Later on, there will be different player options (ie witch that has magic or barbarian with more strength).

The last play standing wins and as a result has the best stats.
